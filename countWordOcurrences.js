/*
You need to write a method that counts the number of occurences of a word in a given text.

The word counter is created as follows:

var sample  = "Lorem ipsum";
var counter = wordCounter(text);
Then one can get the count for a given word like this:

console.log(counter.count("Lorem")); // 1
console.log(counter.count("hey"));   // 0
The input texts are simple: they only contain ASCII characters, words are either separate by white spaces or punctuation (only , and .). If the input only contain punctuation or white spaces, it should return a count of 0 for all words.

For performance reasons, your implementations should count the words once and not parse the text each time the count method is called.

const wordCounter = function(text) {
  const cache = {};
  const words = text.split(/[ ,.]+/).map(word => '$' + word);
  words.forEach(word => word in cache? cache[word]++ : cache[word] = 1);
  return {count: (word) => {
    return /[a-z]/i.test(word) && cache['$' + word] || 0
   }
  };
};
