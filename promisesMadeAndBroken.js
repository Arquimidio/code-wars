##The Misadventures of Bob the Highly Paid Consultant ###Chapter 1: Promises Made and Broken

Your company has purchased a new ordering system and hired Bob the Highly Paid Consultant to develop a front end. However, after continuous delays and missed deliverables, his contract has now come to an end. Bob vanishes like a ghost into the fog, leaving you to see if you can salvage the pieces of his work.

One thing is clear: Bob has left a chain of broken promises in his wake.

Can you help to fix things?

Some notes:

You can assume that the functions Bob is calling actually exist and take the given parameters in the given order.
User "12345" is a valid user for testing
Any provided function whose name ends in Async returns a Promise.
Any provided function whose name does not end in Async is synchronous, i.e. calculateShipping().

function submitOrder(user) {
  var shoppingCart, zipCode, shippingRate, orderSuccessful;
  
  // Get the current user's shopping cart
  OrderAPI.getShoppingCartAsync(user).then(function(cart) {
    shoppingCart = cart;
  });
  
  // Also look up the ZIP code from their profile
  CustomerAPI.getProfileAsync(user).then(function(profile) {
    zipCode = profile.zipCode;
  });
  
  // Calculate the shipping fees
  shippingRate = calculateShipping(shoppingCart, zipCode);
  
  // Submit the order
  OrderAPI.placeOrderAsync(shoppingCart, shippingRate).then(function(success) {
    orderSuccessful = success;
  });
  
  console.log(`Your order ${orderSuccessful? "was" : "was NOT"} placed successfully`);
}
